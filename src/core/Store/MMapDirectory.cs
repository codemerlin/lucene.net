    /// guaranteed to fit within the address space.
    /// On 32 bit platforms also consult <see cref="MaxChunkSize" />
    /// if you have problems with mmap failing because of fragmented
    /// address space. If you get an OutOfMemoryException, it is recommened
    /// to reduce the chunk size, until it works.
